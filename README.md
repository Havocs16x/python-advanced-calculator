Python Calculator able to do all types of math is the end goal!

I am a begginer with python and one of my begginer projects with all languages is a simple calculator, this time I want to use python to complete all of my gr 10 math.
My end goal is to be able to solve long equations, graphing equations, and other basic level math.
